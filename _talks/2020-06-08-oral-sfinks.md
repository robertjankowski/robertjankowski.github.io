I proposed modified ADN model where as the input to the model we use the input signed network.

> A figure presents our approach to leverage signed network as an input to the ADN model. The procedure yields both activity and preference distributions from the signed input network for modified ADN model. We begin with (1) finding exponent for $P(k_{out})$ distribution of signed network, which is used in the next step (2) to generate activity distribution. Analogously, the exponent in preference distribution is obtained from $P(k_{in})$ distribution (3). Then we generate agents' preferences (4), which go into rate equation (5). The step in orange is optional (2*). It correlates the activity with the out-degree of the input signed network, i.e. the agent with the highest out-degree will generate more links. The last step (6) constitutes the final rate calculation, where we also utilize the input signed network.
