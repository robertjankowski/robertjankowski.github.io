My first oral presentation during FENS 2019 - 10th Polish Symposium on Physics in Economy and Social Sciences.
I talked about science of science :). Mainly, the usage of machine learning algorithms for application in bibliometrics.
Which paper should we call popular? Is there any popularity threshold (i.e. the number of views)?

_Many thanks to my supervisor Dr Julian Sienkiewicz._
