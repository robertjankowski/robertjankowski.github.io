I am a PhD student in Network Geometry at the University of Barcelona. Currently, I work on network embeddings in multidimensional hyperbolic spaces.

<h1><span style="color:red">News</span></h1>

- <span style="color:blue">(01.2022)</span> New publication in Entropy with Anna Chmiel. The paper discusses the interplay between opinion dynamics and epidemic spreading in multiplex networks ([link](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/1/105)).
- <span style="color:blue">(10.2021)</span> I started my PhD degree at University of Barcelona. I will work with Profs. M. Ángeles Serrano and Marián Boguñá on network geometry topics.
- <span style="color:blue">(07.2021)</span> I was awarded the first prize for my engineering thesis (_Predicting election polls using machine learning tools_) by Section Physics in Economy and Social Sciences of Polish Physical Society.
- <span style="color:blue">(07.2021)</span> I presented a [poster](https://indico.fis.agh.edu.pl/event/69/contributions/228/attachments/152/226/19_Jankowski.pdf) about my master thesis at 11th Polish Symposium on Physics in Economy and Social Science ([FENS 2021](https://indico.fis.agh.edu.pl/event/69/overview))
- <span style="color:blue">(06.2021)</span> I won an award for the best student's presentation at the [SFINKS](http://sfinks.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) conference. I presented an ABM model for generating interaction from agents' preference and their relations.
- <span style="color:blue">(05.2021)</span> I started working with [Dr Anna Chmiel](http://achmiel.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8&Itemid=109&lang=en) in her research grant _"Modeling epidemic spread using comorbidities and social attitudes"_.
- <span style="color:blue">(10.2020)</span> I joined [Prof. Holyst's group](http://fens.if.pw.edu.pl/nasz-zespol/) of Physics in Economy and Social Sciences at WUT in project _"Signed Relations and Structural Balance in Complex Systems: From Data to Models"_ as a student researcher.
- <span style="color:blue">(09.2020)</span> New publication in Acta Physica Polonica A. R. Jankowski, J. Sienkiewicz, Acta Phys Pol A 138(1), 41-47 (2020), [doi: 10.12693/APhysPolA.138.41](http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/138/app138z1p06.pdf).
