Currently, I'm pursing MSc degree in Data Science at WUT. My interests are: (1) **complex networks** (especially agent based modeling in sociophysics and locating the source of diffusion in networks), (2) **natural language processing** (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition) and (3) **graph neural networks** in particular for application in (1) and (2).

At the moment I'm exploring the possibilities of finding the source of information (patient zero in epidemic) in complex networks using GNN. I would like to combine results from the fantastic paper by [R. Paluch _et. al_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20546-3) with deep learning approach.
