Currently, I am pursing MSc degree in Data Science at WUT. My interests are: (1) **complex networks** (especially agent based modeling in sociophysics and locating the source of diffusion in networks), (2) **natural language processing** (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition) and (3) **data mining** with strong emphasis on network science.

At the moment, I am scrutinizing the influence of social media on the global pandemic, COVID-19. The project leverages methods from network science to describe how awareness and the attitudes towards vaccination enlist the total dead and infected ratio.
